Final Project

Description: 

The Purpose of this assignment is to apply the Hadoop knowledge that we learned to a data set, and peform various calculations
based on the framework of our choosing. The data set that i have chosen is, house prices. A series of graphs and metrics will 
be displayed to show the aggregate data. 

Framework:

I will be using the Spark framework to aggregate my dataset. Spark runs on Hadoop and is an analyic data processing tool for large-scale data processing. 

Development Enviroment:

* Windows 10 
* Jupytier Notebook

Results:
* Showed that the following can be accomplished to a dataset in spark:
* Three data set files: house-sales-full.csv, house-sales-simplified.csv, and house-sales-sample.csv can be imported into Juypter Notebook
* Ability to groupBy SalePrice and count the number of houses with that sale price
* Ability to groupBy PropertyType and SalePrice, and Counted the number of houses with those types
* Joined the three .csv files together using the .join() command
* Displayed a bar graph of houses grouped by SalePrice and Date
* Calculated the total Square Feet of all the houses to include: "SqFtLot", "SqFtTotLiving", and "SqFtFinBasement"
* Calculate total square feet of houses and then average of houses based on bathrooms, total living
